# x32-CPU-Simulator

This repo contains python code for a 32 bit CPU architecture emulator, with a GUI.

It is a high level look at the x32 architecture for CPUs. The program gives you control over the 32 bit registers and it allows for setting the registers to and, or, add, subtract, slt (set less then), and multiply registers.

When you execute your set registers, the output reveals the resulting 32 bit registers.

## Getting started

To run the program, it is very simple

First, clone the repository and cd into the directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ibrahimsabieh/x32-CPU-Simulator
$ cd x32-CPU-Simulator
```

Then run

``$ python tester.py``

From the GUI, you can modify the registers to control their actions very similarly to how the CPU actually operates.
